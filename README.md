# Optimisation-Methods in Supply Chain

This project is made to solve the following problem.

Consider a central warehouse (Node with id: 0) and a set of n customers (id: 1, ..., n). All nodes are in a Cartesian coordinate system. Assume that the transition time from node to node is equal to the Euclidean distance between the two nodes. Every customer 𝑖 has a demand for products 𝑑, a required service time 𝑠𝑡௜ and a profit 𝑝. A fleet of trucks is located in the main warehouse. Each of the vehicles has a product capacity equal to 𝑄. The vehicles start at the warehouse, serve customers and then return to the main warehouse. Each vehicle performs one route. Each customer can be covered (it does not have to be covered) by a single vehicle visit. In this case, the customer returns his profit. The total time of a trip (transfer time and customer service time) can not exceed a time limit 𝑇. The purpose of the problem is to design 𝑘 routes that will maximize the overall profit. Obviously, due to the limitations of the maximum time limit, it is not necessary to cover all the customers. Instead, the selected customers must be selected and routed.
